        <h3>
          Q1: How do solar panels work?<span class="arrow">▼</span>
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            <strong>A1:</strong> Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells that absorb photons and release electrons to generate current.

          Q2: What are the benefits of installing solar panels at home?<span class="arrow">▼</span>
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            <strong>A2:</strong>
            - <strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Reduced or even eliminated electricity bills.<br />
            - <strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Lower carbon footprint with renewable energy.<br />
            - <strong>Energy Independence:</strong> Less reliance on grid power, especially during outages.<br />
            - <strong>Property Value:</strong> Homes with solar installations tend to have a higher resale value.

        <h3>
          Q3: Do I need spare tiles?<span class="arrow">▼</span>
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            <strong>A3:</strong> For tile roofs, it is wise to have spare tiles. Homeowners often find extras stored along walls, behind sheds, or in a corner. Though breakage is rare, having spares ensures any accidental damage is quickly fixed, keeping your roof leak free.

        <h3>
          Q4: Are there any holes in my roof after the solar install?<span class="arrow">▼</span>
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            <strong>A4:</strong> A small, approximately 30mm hole is made to feed the DC cable through the roof. This hole is discreetly hidden beneath the panels and sealed with deck tape and silicone to ensure a leak‐free installation.

          Q5: How does a typical day during installation look?<span class="arrow">▼</span>
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            <strong>A5:</strong> The day begins with an on-site consultation to confirm design details and placement of the inverter and panels. The installer then connects the system to WiFi for monitoring. Depending on your property’s structure, installation typically takes between 2.5 to 6 hours.

          Q6: Do I have to be at home during the installation?<span class="arrow">▼</span>
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            <strong>A6:</strong> No, you do not have to be present the entire time. Most work is carried out on the roof or in the garage, with only brief visits inside if needed.

          Q7: How is roof access managed during installation?<span class="arrow">▼</span>
        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            <strong>A7:</strong> Roof access can be achieved via an available manhole, by temporarily removing a section of the metal roof sheet, or by carefully taking out a few tiles. All removed elements are securely reinstalled after the work is completed.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            <strong>A8:</strong> Yes. At the end of the installation, the system is connected to WiFi and an app is configured so you can monitor your solar production and savings in real time.
