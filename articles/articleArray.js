    <p>
      This article provides a concise overview of how homeowners in Western Australia can significantly reduce the cost of solar installations. It highlights the key federal and state incentives available, including Small-Scale Technology Certificates (STCs), state rebates like the Solar Homes Program, and competitive feed-in tariffs that reward excess energy production.

        <h2 id="sres">Federal Solar Rebate: Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES)</h2>
        <p>The Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) is the primary financial incentive for WA residents installing solar systems. This program offers Small-Scale Technology Certificates (STCs) that reduce the upfront cost of your solar installation.</p>
        <p><strong>STCs Explained:</strong> By installing an eligible solar system, you earn STCs, which are determined by the size and location of your system. The larger and more efficient the system, the more STCs you can receive.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Claim:</strong> Most installers will handle the rebate deduction upfront, making it easy for you to access the benefit.</p>
        <p><strong>Rebate Value in WA:</strong> For a 6.6kW system installed in Perth in 2025, the rebate can range from $2,500 to $3,700.</p>

        <h2 id="debs">Distributed Energy Buyback Scheme (DEBS)</h2>
        <p>The Distributed Energy Buyback Scheme (DEBS) provides payments to eligible households, schools, and non-profit organizations for the surplus energy they export to the grid. This includes energy from rooftop solar systems, home battery storage systems, and even electric vehicles (EVs) capable of exporting power.</p>
        <p><strong>How Does DEBS Work?</strong> DEBS offers higher rates for exported electricity during peak demand periods, which incentivizes the generation and export of energy when the grid needs it the most.</p>

        <p><strong>Off-Peak Periods:</strong> Lower rates are applied from 9 pm to 3 pm, reflecting abundant solar energy and encouraging households to store or self-consume energy.</p>
