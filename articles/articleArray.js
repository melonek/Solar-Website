            <h2>Solar Rebates & Incentives in Western Australia</h2>
            <p>
                This article explores solar incentives in Western Australia, detailing how federal Small-Scale Technology Certificates (STCs) reduce installation costs based on system size. It highlights the stateâ€™s Solar Homes Program, offering up to $3,000 in rebates, and feed-in tariffs (6c-11c per kWh) that pay for excess energy fed back to the grid. In 2025, a 6.6kW system costs $4,000-$6,000 post-rebates, making solar an affordable, eco-friendly choice with long-term savings.

            <h2>Western Australia Solar Incentives 2025</h2>
            <p>
                This article details solar incentives in Western Australia for 2025, including federal Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs) offering $3,000-$3,600 discounts on a 6.6kW system. The Distributed Energy Buyback Scheme (DEBS) provides feed-in tariffs of 10c/kWh (peak) and 3c/kWh (off-peak), potentially earning $300-$400 yearly. Interest-free loans like the Solar Switch Program (up to $10,000) further ease costs. Tips include sizing systems right and timing usage to maximize savings, making solar a smart investment despite no state rebates.
