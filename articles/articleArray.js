        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In Western Australia, the government offers various financial incentives to encourage the adoption of solar energy. These include Small-Scale Technology Certificates (STCs), rebates, and feed-in tariffs. Let's explore how these incentives can reduce the cost of your solar installation and help you contribute to a more sustainable future.</p>

        <h2 id="stcs">Small-Scale Technology Certificates (STCs)</h2>
        <p>STCs are the key federal government incentive for solar panel installations. Homeowners can earn STCs based on the size of their system and its location. The more efficient and larger the system, the greater the number of STCs you can receive, which translates into a greater rebate off the cost of the installation.</p>

        <h2 id="rebates">State Rebates in WA</h2>
        <p>In addition to the federal incentives, the Western Australian government offers additional rebates to encourage solar uptake. One of the most notable is the <strong>Solar Homes Program</strong>, which provides up to $3,000 towards the installation of solar power systems for eligible households.</p>
    
        <h2 id="feedintariffs">Feed-in Tariffs</h2>
        <p>Western Australia offers competitive feed-in tariffs for excess solar energy fed back into the grid. The rate depends on your retailer, but it can range from 0.2c per kWh during peak periods and 0.10c per kWh after 3 pm in some areas. This helps offset the cost of your electricity bills, making solar energy even more attractive for households and businesses.</p>
    
        <h2 id="pricing">Rebate Pricing in 2025</h2>
        <p>The average cost of a 6.6kW solar system in Western Australia is around $4,000 to $6,000 after rebates. This is based on current solar panel prices and available incentives in 2025. The cost may vary depending on the size of the system and the installer, but with rebates and feed-in tariffs, you can see a return on your investment in just a few years.</p>
    
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>By taking advantage of federal and state incentives, homeowners in Western Australia can significantly reduce the upfront cost of solar power systems. Additionally, feed-in tariffs allow you to generate income by selling excess energy back to the grid. As solar technology continues to improve, the savings and benefits of solar power will only continue to grow.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Are you considering installing solar panels for your home or business in Western Australia? With abundant sunshine and several financial incentives, WA offers a great environment for solar energy investment. While WA does not have state-specific solar rebates, residents can take advantage of federal incentives and other programs that significantly reduce costs and maximize savings.</p>

        <h2 id="sres">Federal Solar Rebate: Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES)</h2>
        <p>The Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) is the primary financial incentive for WA residents installing solar systems. This program offers Small-Scale Technology Certificates (STCs) that reduce the upfront cost of your solar installation.</p>
        <p><strong>STCs Explained:</strong> By installing an eligible solar system, you earn STCs, which are determined by the size and location of your system. The larger and more efficient the system, the more STCs you can receive.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Claim:</strong> Most installers will handle the rebate deduction upfront, making it easy for you to access the benefit.</p>
        <p><strong>Rebate Value in WA:</strong> For a 6.6kW system installed in Perth in 2025, the rebate can range from $2,500 to $3,700.</p>

        <h2 id="debs">Distributed Energy Buyback Scheme (DEBS)</h2>
        <p>The Distributed Energy Buyback Scheme (DEBS) provides payments to eligible households, schools, and non-profit organizations for the surplus energy they export to the grid. This includes energy from rooftop solar systems, home battery storage systems, and even electric vehicles (EVs) capable of exporting power.</p>
        <p><strong>How Does DEBS Work?</strong> DEBS offers higher rates for exported electricity during peak demand periods, which incentivizes the generation and export of energy when the grid needs it the most.</p>
