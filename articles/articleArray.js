            <h2>Solar Rebates & Incentives in Western Australia</h2>
            <p>
                This article explores solar incentives in Western Australia, detailing how federal Small-Scale Technology Certificates (STCs) reduce installation costs based on system size. It highlights the state’s Solar Homes Program, offering up to $3,000 in rebates, and feed-in tariffs (6c-11c per kWh) that pay for excess energy fed back to the grid. In 2025, a 6.6kW system costs $4,000-$6,000 post-rebates, making solar an affordable, eco-friendly choice with long-term savings.

            <h2>Western Australia Solar Incentives 2025</h2>
            <p>
                This article details solar incentives in Western Australia for 2025, including federal Small-scale Technology Certificates (STCs) offering $3,000-$3,600 discounts on a 6.6kW system. The Distributed Energy Buyback Scheme (DEBS) provides feed-in tariffs of 10c/kWh (peak) and 3c/kWh (off-peak), potentially earning $300-$400 yearly. Interest-free loans like the Solar Switch Program (up to $10,000) further ease costs. Tips include sizing systems right and timing usage to maximize savings, making solar a smart investment despite no state rebates.

            <h2>Why Solar System Size Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Choosing the right solar system size is key to maximizing energy savings and meeting your household’s needs. In Australia, solar systems are measured in kilowatts (kW), and their size determines how many panels you’ll need and how much power they’ll generate. With abundant sunshine and a growing green energy market, understanding these sizes helps you make an informed decision.
            </p>
            <h2>Common Solar System Sizes in Australia</h2>
            <p>
                Most Australian homes opt for systems ranging from 6.6kW to 20kW, depending on energy usage, roof space, and budget. Here’s a breakdown based on 440W panels, a popular choice in 2025:
            </p>

                    </tr>
                </tfoot>
            </table>
            <h2>How Panel Count Affects Output</h2>
            <p>
                Each 440W panel generates about 1.6-2 kWh per day in Australia, depending on sunlight exposure. Larger systems require more panels and deliver higher outputs, suitable for larger homes or businesses.
            </p>
            <h2>Factors to Consider</h2>
            <p>
                When choosing a system size, consider your energy needs, roof space, budget, and potential incentives. Larger systems offer greater savings but come with higher upfront costs.

  "summary": "\n<h2>Program Overview</h2>\n<p>The WA Residential Battery Scheme launched on 1 July 2025 to accelerate home energy storage in Western Australia. By combining state rebates with the Federal Cheaper Home Batteries Program (providing roughly a 30% discount), households can achieve total upfront cost reductions of around 40–55% on a typical 10 kWh system. The scheme targets up to 100,000 installations, adding approximately 1 GWh of distributed storage to the grid.</p>\n<h2>State Rebate Details</h2>\n<p>• <strong>Synergy (metro WA):</strong> $130 per kWh (max 10 kWh → $1,300)<br>• <strong>Horizon Power (regional WA):</strong> $380 per kWh (max 10 kWh → $3,800)<br>Systems must be VPP‑capable, ≥5 kWh usable capacity, internet‑connected, and installed by accredited vendors.</p>\n<h2>Federal Top‑Up Support</h2>\n<p>The Commonwealth Cheaper Home Batteries Program provides around a 30% discount on battery installations (5–100 kWh) and stacks with state rebates so a 10 kWh system can receive up to $5,000 (Synergy) or $7,500 (Horizon), further reducing out‑of‑pocket costs.</p>\n<h2>VPP &amp; Loan Options</h2>\n<p>All participants must enrol in a Virtual Power Plant, earning export payments (~6 ¢/kWh) and helping stabilize the grid. An optional 0% interest loan of $2,001–$10,000 (income cap $210,000) is available over 3–10 years, with no fees or collateral.</p>\n<h2>Cost &amp; Savings</h2>\n<p>Typical Perth home saves $400–$1,500 annually post‑rebates. A 10 kWh install costing $12,000 can drop to around $7,100 net (Synergy) or $4,600 net (Horizon). Payback periods of 2–4 years are common, with additional VPP income.</p>\n",
